# Extract create-branch skill from branch command

## Overview

The `/branch` command currently contains inline instructions for creating a timestamped branch. Extract this into a `create-branch` skill with a bundled shell script, following the established pattern used by other skills like `archive-ticket` and `create-pr`.

This enables permission-free execution (bundled scripts don't require user approval) and makes the branch creation logic reusable by other commands or agents.

## Key Files

- `plugins/core/commands/branch.md` - Command to simplify by referencing skill
- `plugins/core/skills/create-branch/SKILL.md` - New skill definition (create)
- `plugins/core/skills/create-branch/sh/create.sh` - New shell script (create)

## Related History

The pattern of bundling shell scripts into skills for permission-free execution was established to avoid user prompts.

Past tickets that touched similar areas:

- `20260127193706-bundle-shell-scripts-for-permission-free-skills.md` - Established bundled script pattern (same layer: Config)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create skill directory and SKILL.md**:
   - Create `plugins/core/skills/create-branch/SKILL.md`
   - Add frontmatter: `name: create-branch`, `description: Create timestamped topic branch`, `allowed-tools: Bash`, `user-invocable: false`
   - Document the script usage and output format

2. **Create shell script** at `plugins/core/skills/create-branch/sh/create.sh`:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh -eu
   # Create timestamped topic branch
   # Usage: create.sh <prefix>
   # Example: create.sh feat

   set -eu

   PREFIX="$1"

   if [ -z "$PREFIX" ]; then
       echo "Usage: create.sh <prefix>"
       echo "Prefixes: feat, fix, refact"
       exit 1
   fi

   TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   BRANCH="${PREFIX}-${TIMESTAMP}"

   git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
   echo "$BRANCH"
   ```

3. **Update branch command** to reference the skill:
   - Keep the user interaction (prefix selection via AskUserQuestion)
   - Replace inline bash with reference to skill script:
     ```bash
     bash .claude/skills/create-branch/sh/create.sh <prefix>
     ```
   - The command handles the UX, the skill handles the execution

## Considerations

- The command still owns the user interaction (asking for prefix)
- The skill handles the git operation (creating the branch)
- Script outputs the created branch name for confirmation
- Follow the same pattern as other skills with bundled scripts

## Final Report

Created the create-branch skill with SKILL.md and sh/create.sh. The skill takes a prefix argument, generates a timestamp, creates and checks out the branch, then outputs the branch name. Updated the branch command to reference the skill script instead of inline bash commands. The command still handles user interaction (prefix selection) while the skill handles execution.
