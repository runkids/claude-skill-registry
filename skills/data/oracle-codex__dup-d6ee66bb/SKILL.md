# Codex Oracle

Use OpenAI Codex CLI as a **planning oracle** and **code reviewer**. Codex provides analysis and recommendations; Claude synthesizes and presents to the user.

**Critical**: This skill is for planning and review ONLY. Never use Codex to implement changes.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking Codex, validate availability:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/oracle-codex/scripts/check-codex.sh
```

If the script exits non-zero, display the error message and stop. Do not proceed without Codex CLI.

For `codex exec`, prefer the wrapper script (handles flag compatibility and surfaces errors):

```bash
~/.agents/skills/oracle-codex/scripts/run-codex-exec.sh
```

## Configuration Defaults

| Setting   | Default                       | User Override                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Model     | `gpt-5.2-codex`               | "use model X" or "with gpt-5.2-codex"         |
| Reasoning | Dynamic (based on complexity) | "use medium reasoning" or "with xhigh effort" |
| Sandbox   | `read-only`                   | Not overridable (safety constraint)           |
| Timeout   | 5 minutes minimum             | Estimate based on task complexity             |

### Timeout Guidelines

When invoking `codex exec` via the Bash tool, always set an appropriate timeout:

- **Minimum**: 5 minutes (300000ms) for any Codex operation
- **Simple queries** (single file review, focused question): 5 minutes (300000ms)
- **Moderate complexity** (multi-file review, feature planning): 10 minutes (600000ms)
- **High complexity** (`high` reasoning): 15 minutes minimum (900000ms)
- **Maximum complexity** (`xhigh` reasoning): 20 minutes (1200000ms)

### Reasoning Effort Guidelines

Select reasoning effort based on task complexity:

| Complexity | Effort   | Examples                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple     | `low`    | Single file review, syntax check, quick question              |
| Moderate   | `medium` | Multi-file review, focused feature planning, bug analysis     |
| Complex    | `high`   | Architecture analysis, cross-cutting concerns, security audit |
| Maximum    | `xhigh`  | Large codebase planning, comprehensive design, deep reasoning |

**Selection heuristics:**

- **`low`**: Task involves \<3 files, simple question, or quick validation
- **`medium`**: Task involves 3-10 files or requires moderate analysis
- **`high`**: Task spans multiple modules or requires architectural thinking
- **`xhigh`**: Task requires comprehensive codebase understanding or critical decisions

For available models and reasoning levels, consult `references/codex-flags.md`.

## Workflow

### 1. Validate Prerequisites

Run the check script. On failure, report the installation instructions and abort.

### 2. Determine Mode

- **Planning mode**: User wants architecture, implementation approach, or design decisions
- **Review mode**: User wants code analysis, bug detection, or improvement suggestions
  - **Preferred**: Use `codex review` subcommand (simpler, see below)

### 2b. Quick Review with `codex review`

For code review requests, prefer the dedicated `codex review` subcommand:

```bash
# Review uncommitted changes
codex review --uncommitted

# Review changes against a base branch
codex review --base main

# Review a specific commit
codex review --commit <SHA>

# With custom focus instructions
codex review --base main "Focus on security and error handling"
```

**Important**: Before using `--uncommitted`, verify there are changes to review:

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes (staged or unstaged)
if git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet; then
  echo "No uncommitted changes to review"
  # Fall back to --base or inform user
fi
```

If there are no uncommitted changes, either:

1. Use `--base <branch>` to review committed changes against a branch
2. Inform the user there's nothing to review

This is simpler than `codex exec` for review workflows. Fall back to `codex exec` when more control is needed (custom prompts, specific reasoning effort, output redirection).

### 3. Construct Prompt

Build a focused prompt for Codex based on mode:

**Planning prompt template:**

```
Analyze this codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan for: [user request]

Focus on:
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Files to create or modify
- Implementation sequence
- Potential risks or blockers

Do NOT implement anything. Provide analysis and recommendations only.
```

**Review prompt template:**

```
Review the following code for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adherence to best practices

[code or file paths]

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file locations and line references.
```

### 4. Assess Complexity and Execute Codex

Before executing, assess task complexity to select appropriate reasoning effort:

1. **Count files involved** in the query
2. **Evaluate scope** (single module vs cross-cutting)
3. **Consider depth** (surface review vs architectural analysis)

Use HEREDOC syntax for safe prompt handling. **Always use the Bash tool's timeout parameter** (minimum 300000ms / 5 minutes).

Redirect output to a temp file to avoid context bloat and race conditions.

**Step 1**: Generate a unique temp file path using `$RANDOM` for randomness:

```bash
CODEX_OUTPUT="/tmp/codex-${RANDOM}${RANDOM}.txt"
```

**Step 2**: Execute Codex via the wrapper (detects supported flags and surfaces stderr):

```bash
# Select EFFORT based on complexity assessment (low/medium/high/xhigh)
# Bash tool timeout: 5-20 minutes based on complexity
MODEL="${MODEL:-gpt-5.2-codex}" \
EFFORT="${EFFORT}" \
CODEX_OUTPUT="$CODEX_OUTPUT" \
~/.agents/skills/oracle-codex/scripts/run-codex-exec.sh <<'EOF'
[constructed prompt]
EOF
```

**Important flags:**

- `-m`: Model selection
- `-c model_reasoning_effort=`: Reasoning depth (low/medium/high/xhigh) — select based on Reasoning Effort Guidelines
- `-s read-only`: Prevents any file modifications (non-negotiable)
- `--skip-git-repo-check`: Works outside git repositories (exec-specific)
- `-o <file>`: Write output to file (cleaner than shell redirection)
- `--search`: Enable web search for queries needing current information (optional)
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppresses stderr (progress/thinking output)

**Bash tool timeout**: Estimate based on task complexity (see Timeout Guidelines above). Never use the default 2-minute timeout for Codex operations.

### 5. Present Codex Output

**Step 3**: Read the analysis from the temp file and display to the user:

```bash
cat "$CODEX_OUTPUT"
```

Format the output with clear attribution:

```
## Codex Analysis

[Codex output from the temp file]

---
Model: gpt-5.2-codex | Reasoning: [selected effort level]
```

For very large outputs (>5000 lines), summarize key sections rather than displaying everything.

### 6. Synthesize and Plan

After presenting Codex output:

1. Synthesize key insights from Codex analysis
2. Identify actionable items and critical decisions
3. **If Codex's analysis presents multiple viable approaches or significant trade-offs**, consider using `AskUserQuestion` to clarify user preferences before finalizing the plan
4. Write a structured plan
5. Call `ExitPlanMode` to present the plan for user approval

**When to use AskUserQuestion:**

- Codex proposes multiple architectures with different trade-offs
- Technology or library choices need user input
- Scope decisions (minimal vs comprehensive) are ambiguous

**Skip clarification when:**

- Codex's recommendations are clear and unambiguous
- User's original request already specified preferences
- Only one viable approach exists

## Error Handling

The check script returns specific exit codes:

| Exit Code | Error                   | Response                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | Codex not installed     | Show installation instructions from check script |
| 2         | Codex not responding    | Suggest running `codex --version` manually       |
| 3         | Codex not authenticated | Show login instructions from check script        |

The `codex review` command returns:

| Exit Code | Meaning                                    | Response                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Review completed                           | Present results                           |
| 2         | Nothing to review (e.g., no changes found) | Inform user; suggest alternative (--base) |

The `codex exec` command returns:

| Exit Code | Meaning                                                    | Response                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Exec completed                                             | Present results                                                |
| 1         | Prompt/config error or runtime failure                     | Show stderr and adjust prompt/config                           |
| 2         | CLI usage error (usually unsupported flag / bad arguments) | Use the wrapper script or re-check `codex exec --help` options |

Runtime errors:

| Error          | Response                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex timeout  | Inform user, suggest simpler query or lower reasoning |
| API rate limit | Wait and retry, or inform user of limit               |
| Empty response | Retry once, then report failure                       |
