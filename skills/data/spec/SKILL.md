name: spec
description: 'Requirements discovery through structured interview. Use when WHAT is unclear—scope needs definition, requirements need gathering, or starting from scratch. Outputs spec document, not executable manifest.'
---

**User request**: $ARGUMENTS

Build requirements spec through structured discovery interview. Defines WHAT and WHY - not technical implementation (architecture, APIs, data models come in planning phase).

**If $ARGUMENTS is empty**: Ask user "What work would you like to specify? (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)" via AskUserQuestion before proceeding to Phase 1.

**Loop**: Research → Expand todos → Ask questions → Write findings → Repeat until complete

**Role**: Senior Product Manager - questions that uncover hidden requirements, edge cases, and assumptions the user hasn't considered. Reduce ambiguity through concrete options.

**Spec file**: `/tmp/spec-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md` - updated after each iteration.

**Interview log**: `/tmp/spec-interview-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md` - external memory.

**Timestamp format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (e.g., `20260109-143052`). Generate once at Phase 1.1 start. Use same value for both file paths. Running /spec again creates new files (no overwrite).

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### 1.1 Create todo list (TodoWrite immediately)

Todos = **areas to discover**, not interview steps. Each todo reminds you what conceptual area needs resolution. List continuously expands as user answers reveal new areas. "Finalize spec" is fixed anchor; all others are dynamic.

**Starter todos** (seeds only - list grows as discovery reveals new areas):

```
- [ ] Determine work type; done when type classified
- [ ] Context research→log (if code work); done when patterns understood
- [ ] Scope & target users→log; done when boundaries clear
- [ ] Core requirements→log; done when must-haves captured
- [ ] (expand: areas as discovered)
- [ ] Refresh: read full interview log
- [ ] Finalize spec; done when no [TBD] markers + completeness test passes
```

### Todo Evolution Example

Query: "Add user notifications feature"

Initial:
```
- [ ] Context research→log; done when patterns understood
- [ ] Scope & target users→log; done when boundaries clear
- [ ] Core requirements→log; done when must-haves captured
- [ ] Refresh: read full interview log
- [ ] Finalize spec; done when no [TBD] markers + completeness test passes
```

After user says "needs to work across mobile and web":
```
- [x] Context research→log; found existing admin alerts system
- [ ] Scope & target users→log; done when boundaries clear
- [ ] Core requirements→log; done when must-haves captured
- [ ] Mobile notification delivery→log; done when push/in-app decided
- [ ] Web notification delivery→log; done when mechanism chosen
- [ ] Cross-platform sync→log; done when sync strategy defined
- [ ] Refresh: read full interview log
- [ ] Finalize spec; done when no [TBD] markers + completeness test passes
```

After user mentions "also needs email digest option":
```
- [x] Context research→log; found existing admin alerts system
- [x] Scope & target users→log; all active users, v1 MVP
- [ ] Core requirements→log; done when must-haves captured
- [x] Mobile notification delivery→log; push + in-app decided
- [ ] Web notification delivery→log; done when mechanism chosen
- [ ] Cross-platform sync→log; done when sync strategy defined
- [ ] Email digest frequency→log; done when timing options decided
- [ ] Email vs real-time prefs→log; done when preference model clear
- [ ] Refresh: read full interview log
- [ ] Finalize spec; done when no [TBD] markers + completeness test passes
```

**Key**: Todos grow as user reveals complexity. Never prune prematurely.

### 1.2 Create interview log

Path: `/tmp/spec-interview-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md` (use SAME path for ALL updates)

```markdown
# Interview Log: {work name}
Started: {timestamp}

## Research Phase
(populated incrementally)

## Interview Rounds
(populated incrementally)

## Decisions Made
(populated incrementally)

## Unresolved Items
(populated incrementally)
```

## Phase 2: Initial Context Gathering

### 2.0 Determine if codebase research is relevant

**Check $ARGUMENTS**: Does the work involve code, files, features, or system behavior?

| If $ARGUMENTS... | Then... |
|------------------|---------|
| References code files, functions, components, features, bugs, refactors, or system behavior | Proceed to 2.1 (codebase research) |
| Is about external research, analysis, comparison, or domain decisions (e.g., "research best X", "compare options", "find optimal Y") | SKIP to Phase 3 (interview) |

**Indicators of NON-CODE work** (skip codebase research):
- Keywords: "research", "find best", "compare options", "analyze market", "evaluate vendors", "select tool"
- No mention of files, functions, components, APIs, or system behavior
- Domain-specific decisions: investments, vendors, technologies to adopt, market analysis

**Indicators of CODE work** (do codebase research):
- Keywords: "add feature", "fix bug", "refactor", "implement", "update", "migrate"
- References to files, functions, APIs, database schemas, components
- System behavior changes, UI modifications, integration work

**If unclear**: Ask user via AskUserQuestion: "Is this spec about code/system changes, or external research/analysis?" with options:
- "Code/system changes" → Proceed to 2.1
- "External research/analysis" → Skip to Phase 3

---

**Prerequisites** (for code work only): Requires vibe-workflow plugin with codebase-explorer and web-researcher agents installed. If Task tool fails with agent not found, inform user: "Required agent {name} not available. Install vibe-workflow plugin or proceed with manual research?" If proceeding manually, use Read/Glob/Grep for codebase exploration and note `[LIMITED RESEARCH: {agent} unavailable]` in interview log.

### 2.1 Launch codebase-explorer (code work only)

Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:codebase-explorer"` to understand context. Launch multiple in parallel (single message) for cross-cutting work. Limit to 3 parallel researchers per batch. If findings conflict, immediately present both perspectives to user via AskUserQuestion: "Research found conflicting information about {topic}: {perspective A} vs {perspective B}. Which applies to your situation?" If user cannot resolve, document both perspectives in spec with `[CONTEXT-DEPENDENT: {perspective A} applies when X; {perspective B} applies when Y]` and ask follow-up to clarify applicability. If 3 researchers don't cover all needed areas, run additional batches sequentially.

Explore: product purpose, existing patterns, user flows, terminology, product docs (CUSTOMER.md, SPEC.md, PRD.md, BRAND_GUIDELINES.md, DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md, README.md), existing specs in `docs/` or `specs/`. For bug fixes: also explore bug context, related code, potential causes.

### 2.2 Read recommended files (code work only)

Read ALL files from researcher prioritized reading lists - no skipping.

### 2.3 Launch web-researcher (if needed, code work only)

Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:web-researcher"` when you cannot answer a question from codebase research alone and the answer requires: domain concepts unfamiliar to you, current industry standards or best practices, regulatory/compliance requirements, or competitor UX patterns. Do not use for questions answerable from codebase or general knowledge. Returns all findings in response - no additional file reads needed. Continue launching throughout interview as gaps emerge.

### 2.4 Update interview log (code work only)

After EACH research step, append to interview log:

```markdown
### {HH:MM:SS} - {what researched}
- Explored: {areas/topics}
- Key findings: {list}
- New areas identified: {list}
- Questions to ask: {list}
```

### 2.5 Write initial draft

Write first draft with `[TBD]` markers for unresolved items. Use same file path for all updates.

### Phase 2 Complete When

**For code work**:
- All codebase-explorer tasks finished
- All recommended files read
- Initial draft written with `[TBD]` markers
- Interview log populated with research findings

**For non-code work** (external research/analysis):
- Phase 2 skipped per 2.0 decision
- Initial draft written with `[TBD]` markers (based on $ARGUMENTS only)
- Proceed directly to Phase 3 interview

## Phase 3: Iterative Discovery Interview

**CRITICAL**: Use AskUserQuestion tool for ALL questions - never plain text.

**Example** (the `questions` array supports 1-4 questions per call - that's batching):
```
questions: [
  {
    question: "Who should receive these notifications?",
    header: "User Scope",
    options: [
      { label: "All active users (Recommended)", description: "Broadest reach, simplest logic" },
      { label: "Premium users only", description: "Limited scope, may need upgrade prompts" },
      { label: "Users who opted in", description: "Requires preference system first" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  },
  {
    question: "How should notifications be delivered?",
    header: "Delivery",
    options: [
      { label: "In-app only (Recommended)", description: "Simplest, no external dependencies" },
      { label: "Push + in-app", description: "Requires push notification setup" },
      { label: "Email digest", description: "Async, requires email service" }
    ],
    multiSelect: true
  }
]
```

### Discovery Loop

For each step:
1. Mark todo `in_progress`
2. Research OR ask question (AskUserQuestion)
3. **Write findings immediately** to interview log
4. Expand todos for: new areas revealed, follow-up questions, dependencies discovered
5. Update spec file (replace `[TBD]` markers)
6. Mark todo `completed`
7. Repeat until no pending todos

**NEVER proceed without writing findings first** — interview log is external memory.

### Interview Log Update Format

After EACH question/answer, append (Round = one AskUserQuestion call, may contain batched questions):

```markdown
### Round {N} - {HH:MM:SS}
**Todo**: {which todo this addresses}
**Question asked**: {question}
**User answer**: {answer}
**Impact**: {what this revealed/decided}
**New areas**: {list or "none"}
```

After EACH decision (even implicit), append to Decisions Made:

```markdown
- {Decision area}: {choice} — {rationale}
```

### Todo Expansion Triggers

| Discovery Reveals | Add Todos For |
|-------------------|---------------|
| New affected area | Requirements for that area |
| Integration need | Integration constraints |
| Compliance/regulatory | Compliance requirements |
| Multiple scenarios/flows | Each scenario's behavior |
| Error conditions | Error handling approach |
| Performance concern | Performance constraints/metrics |
| Existing dependency | Dependency investigation |
| Rollback/recovery need | Recovery strategy |
| Data preservation need | Data integrity requirements |

### Interview Rules

**Unbounded loop**: Keep iterating (research → question → update spec) until ALL completion criteria are met. No fixed round limit - continue as long as needed for complex problems. If user says "just infer the rest" or similar, document remaining decisions with `[INFERRED: {choice} - {rationale}]` markers and finalize.

1. **Prioritize questions that eliminate other questions** - Ask questions where the answer would change what other questions you need to ask, or would eliminate entire branches of requirements. If knowing X makes Y irrelevant, ask X first.

2. **Interleave discovery and questions**:
   - User answer reveals new area → launch codebase-explorer
   - Need domain knowledge → launch web-researcher
   - Update spec after each iteration, replacing `[TBD]` markers

3. **Question priority order**:

   | Priority | Type | Purpose | Examples |
   |----------|------|---------|----------|
   | 1 | Scope Eliminators | Eliminate large chunks of work | V1/MVP vs full? All users or segment? |
   | 2 | Branching | Open/close inquiry lines | User-initiated or system-triggered? Real-time or async? |
   | 3 | Hard Constraints | Non-negotiable limits | Regulatory requirements? Must integrate with X? |
   | 4 | Differentiating | Choose between approaches | Pattern A vs B? Which UX model? |
   | 5 | Detail Refinement | Fine-grained details | Exact copy, specific error handling |

4. **Always mark one option "(Recommended)"** - put first with reasoning in description. Question whether each requirement is truly needed—don't pad with nice-to-haves. When options are equivalent AND reversible without data migration or API changes, decide yourself (lean simpler). When options are equivalent BUT have different user-facing tradeoffs, ask user.

5. **Be thorough via technique**:
   - Cover everything relevant - don't skip to save time
   - Reduce cognitive load through HOW you ask: concrete options, good defaults
   - **Batching**: Up to 4 questions in `questions` array per call (batch questions that address the same todo or decision area); max 4 options per question (tool limit)
   - Make decisions yourself when context suffices
   - Complete spec with easy questions > incomplete spec with fewer questions

6. **Ask non-obvious questions** - Uncover what user hasn't explicitly stated: motivations behind requirements, edge cases affecting UX, business rules implied by use cases, gaps between user expectations and feasibility, tradeoffs user may not have considered

7. **Ask vs Decide** - User is authority for business decisions; codebase/standards are authority for implementation details.

   **Ask user when**:
   | Category | Examples |
   |----------|----------|
   | Business rules | Pricing logic, eligibility criteria, approval thresholds |
   | User segments | Who gets this? All users, premium, specific roles? |
   | Tradeoffs with no winner | Speed vs completeness, flexibility vs simplicity |
   | Scope boundaries | V1 vs future, must-have vs nice-to-have |
   | External constraints | Compliance, contracts, stakeholder requirements |
   | Preferences | Opt-in vs opt-out, default on vs off |

   **Decide yourself when**:
   | Category | Examples |
   |----------|----------|
   | Existing pattern | Error format, naming conventions, component structure |
   | Industry standard | HTTP status codes, validation rules, retry strategies |
   | Sensible defaults | Timeout values, pagination limits, debounce timing |
   | Easily changed later (single-file change, no data migration, no API contract change) | Copy text, colors, specific thresholds |
   | Implementation detail | Which hook to use, event naming, internal state shape |

   **Test**: "If I picked wrong, would user say 'that's not what I meant' (ASK) or 'that works, I would have done similar' (DECIDE)?"

## Phase 4: Finalize & Summarize

### 4.1 Final interview log update

```markdown
## Interview Complete
Finished: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS} | Questions: {count} | Decisions: {count}
## Summary
{Brief summary of discovery process}
```

### 4.2 Refresh context

Read the full interview log file to restore all decisions, findings, and rationale into context before writing the final spec.

### 4.3 Finalize specification

Final pass: remove `[TBD]` markers, ensure consistency. Use this **minimal scaffolding** - add sections dynamically based on what discovery revealed:

```markdown
# Requirements: {Work Name}

Generated: {date}

## Overview
### Problem Statement
{What is wrong/missing/needed? Why now?}

### Scope
{What's included? What's explicitly excluded?}

### Affected Areas
{Systems, components, processes, users impacted}

### Success Criteria
{Observable outcomes that prove this work succeeded}

## Requirements
{Verifiable statements about what's true when this work is complete. Each requirement should be specific enough to check as true/false.}

### Core Behavior
- {Verifiable outcome}
- {Another verifiable outcome}

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- When {condition}, {what happens}

## Constraints
{Non-negotiable limits, dependencies, prerequisites}

## Out of Scope
{Non-goals with reasons}

## {Additional sections as needed based on discovery}
{Add sections relevant to this specific work - examples below}
```

**Dynamic sections** - add based on what discovery revealed (illustrative, not exhaustive):

| Discovery Reveals | Add Section |
|-------------------|-------------|
| User-facing behavior | Screens/states (empty, loading, success, error), interactions, accessibility |
| API/technical interface | Contract (inputs/outputs/errors), integration points, versioning |
| Bug context | Current vs expected, reproduction steps, verification criteria |
| Refactoring | Current/target structure, invariants (what must NOT change) |
| Infrastructure | Rollback plan, monitoring, failure modes |
| Migration | Data preservation, rollback, cutover strategy |
| Performance | Current baseline, target metrics, measurement method |
| Data changes | Schema, validation rules, retention |
| Security & privacy | Auth/authz requirements, data sensitivity, audit needs |
| User preferences | Configurable options, defaults, persistence |
| External integrations | Third-party services, rate limits, fallbacks |
| Observability | Analytics events, logging, success/error metrics |

**Specificity**: Each requirement should be verifiable. "User can log in" is too vague; "on valid credentials → redirect to dashboard; on invalid → show inline error, no page reload" is right.

### 4.4 Mark all todos complete

### 4.5 Output approval summary

Present a scannable summary that allows approval without reading the full spec. Users may approve based on this summary alone.

```
## Spec Approval Summary: {Work Name}

**Full spec**: /tmp/spec-{...}.md

### At a Glance
| Aspect | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| Problem | {One-liner problem statement} |
| Scope | {What's in / explicitly out} |
| Users | {Who's affected} |
| Success | {Primary observable success criterion} |

### State Flow

{ASCII state machine showing main states/transitions of the feature}

Example format:
┌─────────────┐   action    ┌─────────────┐
│  STATE A    │────────────>│  STATE B    │
└─────────────┘             └─────────────┘
       │                          │
       v                          v
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              OUTCOME STATE              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Generate diagram that captures:
- Key states the system/user moves through
- Transitions (user actions or system events)
- Terminal states or outcomes

### Requirements ({count} total)

**Core** (must have):
- {Requirement 1}
- {Requirement 2}
- {Requirement 3}
- ...

**Edge Cases**:
- {Edge case 1}: {behavior}
- {Edge case 2}: {behavior}

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| {Area 1} | {Choice} | {Brief why} |
| {Area 2} | {Choice} | {Brief why} |

### Out of Scope
- {Non-goal 1}
- {Non-goal 2}

---
Approve to proceed to planning, or request adjustments.
```

**State machine guidelines**:
- Show the primary flow, not every edge case
- Use box characters: `┌ ┐ └ ┘ │ ─ ┬ ┴ ├ ┤ ┼` or simple ASCII: `+---+`, `|`, `--->`
- Label transitions with user actions or system events
- Keep to 3-7 states for readability
- For CRUD features: show entity lifecycle
- For user flows: show user journey states
- For system changes: show before/after states

## Key Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Write-before-proceed | Write findings BEFORE next question (interview log = external memory) |
| Todo-driven | Every discovery needing follow-up → todo (no mental notes) |
| WHAT not HOW | Requirements only - no architecture, APIs, data models, code patterns. Self-check: if thinking "how to implement," refocus on "what should happen/change" |
| Observable outcomes | Focus on what changes when complete. Ask "what is different after?" not "how does it work internally?" Edge cases = system/business impact |
| Dynamic structure | Spec sections emerge from discovery. No fixed template beyond core scaffolding. Add sections as needed to fully specify the WHAT |
| Complete coverage | Spec covers EVERYTHING implementer needs: behavior, UX, data, errors, edge cases, accessibility - whatever the work touches. If they'd have to guess, it's underspecified |
| Comprehensive spec, minimal questions | Spec covers everything implementer needs. Ask questions only when: (1) answer isn't inferable from codebase/context, (2) wrong guess would require changing 3+ files or redoing more than one day of work, (3) it's a business decision only user can make. Skip questions you can answer via research |
| No open questions | Resolve everything during interview - no TBDs in final spec |
| Question requirements | Don't accept requirements at face value. Ask "is this truly needed for v1?" Don't pad specs with nice-to-haves |
| Reduce cognitive load | Recommended option first, multi-choice over free-text. Free-text only when: options are infinite/unpredictable, asking for specific values (names, numbers), or user needs to describe own context. User accepting defaults should yield solid result |
| Incremental updates | Update interview log after EACH step (not at end) |

### Completion Checklist

Interview complete when ALL true (keep iterating until every box checked):
- [ ] Problem/trigger defined - why this work is needed
- [ ] Scope defined - what's in, what's explicitly out
- [ ] Affected areas identified - what changes
- [ ] Success criteria specified - observable outcomes
- [ ] Core requirements documented (must-have behaviors that define the work's purpose)
- [ ] Edge cases addressed
- [ ] Constraints captured
- [ ] Out of scope listed with reasons
- [ ] No `[TBD]` markers remain
- [ ] Passes completeness test (below)

### Completeness Test (before finalizing)

Simulate three consumers of this spec:

1. **Implementer**: Read each requirement. Could you code it without guessing? If you'd think "I'll ask about X later" → X is underspecified.

2. **Tester**: For each behavior, can you write a test? If inputs/outputs/conditions are unclear → underspecified.

3. **Reviewer**: For each success criterion, how would you verify it shipped correctly? If verification method is unclear → underspecified.

Any question from these simulations = gap to address before finalizing.

### Never Do

- Proceed without writing findings to interview log
- Keep discoveries as mental notes instead of todos
- Skip todo list
- Write specs to project directories (always `/tmp/`)
- Ask about technical implementation
- Finalize with unresolved `[TBD]`
- Skip summary output
- Ask interview questions without AskUserQuestion tool (research findings don't require user questions)
- Proceed past Phase 2 without initial draft
- Forget to expand todos on new areas revealed

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| User declines to answer | Note `[USER SKIPPED: reason]`, flag in summary |
| Insufficient research | Ask user directly, note uncertainty |
| Contradictory requirements | Surface conflict before proceeding |
| User corrects earlier decision | Update spec, log correction with reason, check if other requirements affected |
| Interview interrupted | Spec saved; add `[INCOMPLETE]` at top. To resume: provide existing spec file path as argument |
| Resume interrupted spec | Read provided spec file. If file not found or not a valid spec (missing required sections like Overview, Requirements), inform user: "Could not resume from {path}: {reason}. Start fresh?" via AskUserQuestion. If valid, look for matching interview log at same timestamp, scan for `[TBD]` and `[INCOMPLETE]` markers, present status to user and ask "Continue from {last incomplete area}?" via AskUserQuestion |
| "Just build it" | Push back with 2-3 critical questions (questions where guessing wrong = significant rework). If declined, document assumptions clearly |
