# File Organizer

Your personal organization assistant for maintaining clean, logical file structures without mental overhead.

## When to Use

- Downloads folder is chaotic
- Can't find files (scattered everywhere)
- Duplicate files taking up space
- Folder structure doesn't make sense
- Need better organization habits
- Starting new project structure
- Cleaning up before archiving

## Core Capabilities

1. **Analyze Structure**: Review folders and understand content
1. **Find Duplicates**: Identify duplicate files across system
1. **Suggest Organization**: Propose logical folder structures
1. **Automate Cleanup**: Move, rename, organize with approval
1. **Context-Aware**: Smart decisions based on type, date, content
1. **Reduce Clutter**: Identify old unused files

## Quick Commands

### Downloads Cleanup

```
Organize Downloads folder - move documents to Documents, images to Pictures,
archive files older than 3 months
```

### Find Duplicates

```
Find duplicate files in Documents and help me decide which to keep
```

### Project Organization

```
Review Projects folder and separate active from archived projects
```

### Desktop Cleanup

```
Desktop is covered in files - organize into Documents properly
```

### Photo Organization

```
Organize photos by date (year/month) based on EXIF data
```

### Work/Personal Separation

```
Separate work files from personal files in Documents
```

## Organization Workflow

### 1. Understand Scope

Ask clarifying questions:

- Which directory? (Downloads, Documents, home?)
- Main problem? (Can't find, duplicates, messy, no structure?)
- Files to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)
- How aggressive? (Conservative vs. comprehensive)

### 2. Analyze Current State

```bash
# Overview
eza -la [target]

# File types and sizes
find [target] -type f -exec file {} \; | head -20

# Largest files
du -sh [target]/* | sort -rh | head -20

# File type distribution
find [target] -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

Summarize:

- Total files/folders
- File type breakdown
- Size distribution
- Date ranges
- Organization issues

### 3. Identify Patterns

**By Type:**

- Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)
- Videos (MP4, MOV)
- Archives (ZIP, TAR)
- Code/Projects
- Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)

**By Purpose:**

- Work vs. Personal
- Active vs. Archive
- Project-specific
- Reference materials
- Temporary/scratch

**By Date:**

- Current year/month
- Previous years
- Old (archive candidates)

### 4. Find Duplicates

```bash
# Exact duplicates by hash
find [dir] -type f -exec md5sum {} \; | sort | uniq -d

# Same name
find [dir] -type f -printf '%f\n' | sort | uniq -d

# Similar size
find [dir] -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n
```

For each duplicate set:

- Show all paths
- Display sizes and dates
- Recommend which to keep (newest or best-named)
- **Always ask before deleting**

### 5. Propose Plan

```markdown
# Organization Plan for [Directory]

## Current State
- X files across Y folders
- [Size] total
- File types: [breakdown]
- Issues: [list]

## Proposed Structure
[Directory]/
├── Work/
│   ├── Projects/
│   └── Documents/
├── Personal/
│   ├── Photos/
│   └── Documents/
└── Archive/

## Changes
1. Create folders: [list]
2. Move files:
   - X PDFs → Work/Documents/
   - Y images → Personal/Photos/
3. Rename: [patterns]
4. Delete: [duplicates/trash]

## Need Your Decision
- [uncertain files]

Ready? (yes/no/modify)
```

### 6. Execute

```bash
# Create structure
mkdir -p "path/to/folders"

# Move with logging
mv "old/path/file" "new/path/file"

# Rename consistently
# Format: "YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext"
```

**Rules:**

- Confirm before deleting
- Log all moves for undo
- Preserve modification dates
- Handle conflicts gracefully
- Stop and ask if unexpected

### 7. Provide Summary

```markdown
# Organization Complete! ✨

## What Changed
- Created [X] folders
- Organized [Y] files
- Freed [Z] GB (duplicates)
- Archived [W] old files

## New Structure
[show tree]

## Maintenance Tips
- Weekly: Sort downloads
- Monthly: Archive completed projects
- Quarterly: Check duplicates
- Yearly: Archive old files

## Your Commands
# Find recent files
find . -type f -mtime -7

# Find duplicates
[custom command]
```

## Best Practices

### Folder Naming

- Clear, descriptive names
- No spaces (use hyphens/underscores)
- Be specific: "client-proposals" not "docs"
- Use prefixes: "01-current", "02-archive"

### File Naming

- Include dates: "2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md"
- Be descriptive: "q3-financial-report.xlsx"
- Avoid versions (use version control)
- Clean downloads: "doc-final-v2(1).pdf" → "document.pdf"

### When to Archive

- Not touched in 6+ months
- Completed work for reference
- Old versions after migration
- Hesitant to delete (archive first)

## Pro Tips

1. Start small (one folder at a time)
1. Run weekly cleanup on Downloads
1. Use consistent naming: "YYYY-MM-DD - Description"
1. Archive aggressively (don't delete)
1. Keep active work separate from archives
1. Let Claude handle cognitive load
