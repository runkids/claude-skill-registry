# Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: you must follow the commit message format and guidelines.

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): subject`

**Common types:** feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, chore, style

**Guidelines:**

- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- For simple changes, the subject line may be sufficient
- Add a body when changes involve multiple files or need explanation
- Limit body to 3-5 bullet points for most commits
- **IMPORTANT**: avoid extra newlines/bank lines between bullet points

## When to Include WHY (Not Just WHAT)

Include reasoning only when:

- Security implications exist
- Performance trade-offs were made
- The change fixes a non-obvious bug
- Breaking changes or migration steps are needed
- The approach chosen could be confusing without context

Otherwise, focus on describing WHAT changed **concisely**.

## Examples

### ✅ Good Commit Messages

**Example 1: Feature addition**

```
