# Create Code Skill

The `create-code` skill is the primary coding engine for the **Horus** persona. it orchestrates a multi-stage "Hardened Coding" workflow that ensures code is researched, isolated, tested, and brutally critiqued before completion.

---

## Horus Coding Workflow

The skill follows a strict 6-stage pipeline:

### 1. Idea & Initial Scoping

Horus starts with a high-level idea or requirement.

- **Stage 1 Gate**: Clarification interview to define scope and constraints.

### 2. Deep Research (/dogpile)

Horus research existing implementation patterns, libraries, and potential pitfalls.

- Calls `/dogpile search "<idea> implementation patterns"`
- Aggregates context into a research summary.

### 3. Isolated Execution & Digital Twin (/battle)

Horus spins up an isolated environment to safely test code or run adversarial simulations. This leverages a **Digital Twin** strategy for high-fidelity testing.

- **Tools**: `.pi/skills/battle` for Digital Twin orchestration (isolation). Optionally use `.pi/skills/hack` for security audits.
- **Modes**:
  - `git_worktree`: For repository-level isolation.
  - `docker`: For containerized environment testing.
  - `qemu`: For hardware/microprocessor emulation (firmware).

### 4. Structured Implementation (/task, /orchestrate)

Implementation is driven by `0N_TASKS.md` files with enforced quality gates.

- Uses `/task` to break down the idea into actionable items.
- Uses `/orchestrate` to execute tasks, requiring:
  - **Sanity Tests**: Every task must have a verification script.
  - **Assertions**: Core logic must be asserted.
  - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Strict criteria for task completion.

### 5. Brutal Code Review (/review-code)

Horus submits the code for a multi-round "Brutal Review".

- Calls `/review-code` using **Copilot GPT-5** (or highest reasoning model available).
- Focuses on "No-Vibes" technical correctness, efficiency, and Horus's specific persona standards.

### 6. Final Research & Consolidation (/dogpile)

Horus performs a final dogpile search with the working code and full context to find any last-minute edge cases or optimizations.

- Consolidation of the project into the Horus/Memory knowledge graph.

## Usage

```bash
# Start a new coding project from an idea
./run.sh start "Implement a high-performance vector store with ArangoDB"

# Resume an existing creation in a directory
./run.sh resume /path/to/project

# Run specific stages
./run.sh research "idea"
./run.sh review --provider github --model gpt-5 --yes
./run.sh sandbox --mode docker --yes
./run.sh implement --yes
```

## Commands

| Command     | Description                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`     | Launch full 6-stage workflow from an idea           |
| `research`  | Run Stage 2 Dogpile research                        |
| `sandbox`   | Spin up Stage 3 isolated environment (Digital Twin) |
| `battle`    | Run Stage 3 adversarial battle for hardening        |
| `implement` | Run Stage 4 Task/Orchestrate pipeline               |
| `review`    | Run Stage 5 Brutal Code Review                      |
| `finalize`  | Run Stage 6 Final research and memory commit        |

## Key Principles

1. **Isolation First**: Never run untrusted or experimental code on the host.
2. **Quality Gates**: No code proceeds without passing sanity tests and DoD.
3. **Brutal Critique**: Embody Horus's uncompromising standard for technical excellence.
4. **Memory Integration**: Always check and update the knowledge graph.
