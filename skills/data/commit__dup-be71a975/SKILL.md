# Commit Skill

This skill handles the git commit workflow with a focus on logical grouping and clear documentation.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze State**
    * Run `git status` to identify all untracked, modified, and deleted files.
    * Run `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --cached` (staged) to examine the actual code changes.

2. **Group Changes (Crucial Step)**
    * **Analyze the purpose** of changes across all files.
    * **Decision**:
        * *Single Commit*: If all changes are small or serve a single purpose (e.g., "fix login bug" involved 3 files), keep them together.
        * *Multiple Commits*: If changes cover distinct, unrelated tasks (e.g., "update documentation" AND "refactor database code"), split them into separate commits.
    * *Plan*: If multiple commits are needed, list which files go into which commit.

3. **Draft Commit Messages**
    For each identified commit group:
    * **Header**: `gitmoji <type>(<scope>): <subject>`
        * **Gitmoji**: Use the [Gitmoji Guide](https://gitmoji.dev/) (e.g., ✨ for features, 🐛 for bugs, ♻️ for refactor, 📝 for docs).
        * **Type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
        * **Subject**: Imperative mood, concise.
    * **Body (Optional/Context-Dependent)**:
        * *Small/Simple changes*: No body or 1-2 sentences explaining *why*.
        * *Large/Complex changes*: Use a bulleted list to detail specific changes.

4. **Execute Commits**
    For each group:
    1. `git add <specific_files>` (Do not lazy use `git add .` unless all changes truly belong to one commit).
    2. `git commit -m "header" -m "body"`
    3. Verify success.

## Important Rules

* **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files.
* **Atomic Commits**: Prefer smaller, focused commits over giant "dump" commits.
* **Verification**: Always run `git status` after operations to ensure the working directory state is what you expect.

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Mixed Changes

* *Changes*: `auth.py` (bug fix), `README.md` (typo fix).
* *Action*: Split into two commits.
    1. `git add auth.py` -> `git commit -m "🐛 fix(auth): resolve token expiration issue"`
    2. `git add README.md` -> `git commit -m "📝 docs: fix typo in installation guide"`

### Scenario 2: Large Feature

* *Changes*: 5 files related to a new "Dark Mode".
* *Action*: Single commit.
  * Title: `✨ feat(ui): implement dark mode theming`
  * Body:

        ```text
        - Add theme context provider
        - Update color palette in tailwind config
        - Add toggle switch to settings page
        - Fix contrast issues on dashboard
        ```
