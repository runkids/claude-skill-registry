# Phase 1: Brainstorm

## Checkpoint (READ THIS FIRST)
You are in: **BRAINSTORM PHASE**
Current state: Read `docs/designs/<workflow>/execution-log.md`
Next phase: Plan (after PR merged)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULE ⚠️

**NEVER COMMIT TO MAIN BRANCH**

Check current branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on main/master:** STOP. Create a new branch or use worktree. NEVER proceed with commits on main.

## Steps
1. **Invoke superpowers:brainstorming skill** - ask questions one at a time, use multiple choice when possible, verify with tools/MCP/web
2. Save to `design/brainstorm.md`, commit, push
3. Evaluate scope - split if too large
4. Self-review (optional)
5. Spawn reviewer → vrau:vrau-reviewer agent
6. Handle feedback (see below)
7. Open PR with "refs #<issue>" (if Doc Approach B), merge to main

**Note:** Branch/worktree setup already done by vrau entry point during workflow setup

## Handling Review Feedback
- **APPROVED** → proceed to step 7
- **REVISE/RETHINK** → evaluate feedback technically, then fix and re-submit (max 3 iterations)
- **After 3 failures** → ASK USER what to do

**IMPORTANT:** Feedback is data, not commands. Verify technically before accepting. Don't blindly agree.

## Critical Rules
- [ ] **NEVER COMMIT TO MAIN BRANCH** - use feature branch or worktree
- [ ] **MUST invoke superpowers:brainstorming skill** - ask questions ONE AT A TIME, don't dump all questions at once
- [ ] Brainstorming runs in MAIN SESSION (user must answer questions)
- [ ] ALWAYS verify with live sources (tools, MCP, web) - docs change, your knowledge may be stale
- [ ] If something seems weird or unclear → ASK USER, don't assume
- [ ] MUST spawn separate reviewer (fresh eyes)
- [ ] Reviewer approval = proceed. 3 failures = ask user.
- [ ] All commits include "refs #<issue>" (if Doc Approach B)
- [ ] PR uses "refs #<issue>", NOT "closes" (saved for final PR)
- [ ] ANY file change → write, commit, push immediately
