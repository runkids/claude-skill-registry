# iOS Performance Router

**You MUST use this skill for ANY performance issue including memory leaks, slow execution, battery drain, or profiling.**

## When to Use

Use this router when:
- App feels slow or laggy
- Memory usage grows over time
- Battery drains quickly
- Device gets hot during use
- High energy usage in Battery Settings
- Diagnosing performance with Instruments
- Memory leaks or retain cycles
- App crashes with memory warnings

## Routing Logic

### Memory Issues

**Memory leaks (Swift)** → `/skill axiom-memory-debugging`
- Systematic leak diagnosis
- 5 common leak patterns
- Instruments workflows
- deinit not called

**Memory leaks (Objective-C blocks)** → `/skill axiom-objc-block-retain-cycles`
- Block retain cycles
- Weak-strong pattern
- Network callback leaks

### Performance Profiling

**Performance profiling** → `/skill axiom-performance-profiling`
- Time Profiler (CPU)
- Allocations (memory growth)
- Core Data profiling (N+1 queries)
- Decision trees for tool selection

### Energy Issues

**Battery drain, axiom-high energy** → `/skill axiom-energy`
- Power Profiler workflow
- Subsystem diagnosis (CPU/GPU/Network/Location/Display)
- Anti-pattern fixes
- Background execution optimization

**Symptom-based diagnosis** → `/skill axiom-energy-diag`
- "App at top of Battery Settings"
- "Device gets hot"
- "Background battery drain"
- Time-cost analysis for each path

**API reference with code** → `/skill axiom-energy-ref`
- Complete WWDC code examples
- Timer, network, location efficiency
- BGContinuedProcessingTask (iOS 26)
- MetricKit setup

## Decision Tree

```
User reports performance issue
  ├─ Memory?
  │  ├─ Swift code? → memory-debugging
  │  └─ Objective-C blocks? → objc-block-retain-cycles
  │
  ├─ Energy/Battery?
  │  ├─ Know the symptom? → energy-diag
  │  ├─ Need API reference? → energy-ref
  │  └─ General battery drain? → energy
  │
  ├─ Want to profile?
  │  └─ YES → performance-profiling
  │
  └─ General slow/lag? → performance-profiling
```

## Critical Patterns

**Memory Debugging** (memory-debugging):
- 6 leak patterns: timers, observers, closures, delegates, view callbacks, PhotoKit
- Instruments workflows
- Leak vs caching distinction

**Performance Profiling** (performance-profiling):
- Time Profiler for CPU bottlenecks
- Allocations for memory growth
- Core Data SQL logging for N+1 queries
- Self Time vs Total Time

**Energy Optimization** (energy):
- Power Profiler subsystem diagnosis
- 8 anti-patterns: timers, polling, location, animations, background, network, GPU, disk
- Audit checklists by subsystem
- Pressure scenarios for deadline resistance

## Example Invocations

User: "My app's memory usage keeps growing"
→ Invoke: `/skill axiom-memory-debugging`

User: "I have a memory leak but deinit isn't being called"
