## Core Principles

### Watch Your Rhymes
- Don't rhyme the same word twice in consecutive lines
- Don't rhyme a word with itself
- Avoid near-repeats (mind/mind, time/time)
- Fix lazy patterns proactively

### Automatic Quality Check

**After writing or revising any lyrics**, automatically run through:
1. **Rhyme check**: Repeated end words, self-rhymes, lazy patterns
2. **Prosody check**: Stressed syllables align with strong beats
3. **Pronunciation check**: Proper nouns, homographs, acronyms, tech terms
4. **POV/Tense check**: Consistent throughout
5. **Source verification**: If source-based, match captured material
6. **Structure check**: Section tags, verse/chorus contrast, V2 develops
7. **Pitfalls check**: Run through checklist

Report any violations found. Don't wait to be asked.

## Override Support

Check for custom lyric writing preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Read `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` → `paths.overrides`
2. Check for `{overrides}/lyric-writing-guide.md`
3. If exists: read and incorporate as additional context
4. If not exists: use base guidelines only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/lyric-writing-guide.md`:**
```markdown
# Lyric Writing Guide

## Style Preferences
- Prefer first-person narrative
- Avoid religious imagery
- Use vivid sensory details
- Keep verses 4-6 lines max

## Vocabulary
- Avoid: utilize, commence, endeavor (too formal)
- Prefer: simple, direct language

## Themes
- Focus on: technology, alienation, urban decay
- Avoid: love songs, party anthems

## Custom Rules
- Never use the word "baby" in lyrics
- Avoid clichés: "heart of gold", "burning bright"
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Use as additional context when writing lyrics
3. Apply preferences alongside base principles
4. Override preferences take precedence if conflicting

**Example:**
- Base says: "Show don't tell"
- Override says: "Prefer first-person narrative"
- Result: Show emotion through first-person actions/observations

---

## Prosody (Syllable Stress)

Prosody is matching stressed syllables to strong musical beats.

**Rules:**
- Stressed syllables land on downbeats (beats 1 and 3)
- Multi-syllable words need natural emphasis: HAP-py, not hap-PY
- High melody notes = emphasized words

**Test**: Speak the lyric. If emphasis feels wrong, rewrite it.

---

## Rhyme Techniques

### Rhyme Types (use variety)
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Perfect | Exact match | love/dove |
| Slant/Near | Similar but not exact | love/move |
| Consonance | Same ending consonants | blank/think |
| Assonance | Same vowel sounds | lake/fate |
| Internal | Rhymes within a line | "fire and desire higher" |

### Rhyme Scheme Patterns
| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| AABB | Stable, immediate resolution |
| ABAB | Classic, delayed resolution |
| ABCB | Lighter, less pressure |
| AAAX | Strong setup, surprise ending |

---

## Show Don't Tell

### ACTION - What would someone DO feeling this emotion?
- ❌ "My heart is breaking"
- ✅ "She fell to her knees as he packed his bag"

### IMAGERY - Nouns that can be seen/touched
- ❌ "I felt so sad"
- ✅ "Coffee gone cold on the counter"

### SENSORY DETAIL - Engage multiple senses
- Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, organic (body), kinesthetic (motion)

**Section balance**: Verses = sensory details. Choruses = emotional statements.

---

## Verse/Chorus Contrast

| Element | Verse | Chorus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Lyrics | Observational, narrative | Emotional, universal |
| Energy | Building | Peak |
| Detail | Specific sensory | Abstract emotional |

---

## Hook & Title Placement

- Title in first or last line of chorus
- Repeat title at song's beginning AND end
- Give title priority: rhythmic accent, melodic peak

---

## Line Length

### General Ranges by Genre
| Genre | Syllables/Line |
|-------|----------------|
| Pop/Folk/Punk | 6-8 |
| Rock/Indie | 8-10 |
| Hip-Hop/Rap | 10-13+ |

**Critical**: Verse 1 line lengths must match Verse 2 line lengths.

---

## Point of View & Tense

**POV**: Choose one and maintain it
- First (I/me) - most intimate
- Second (you) - draws listener in
- Third (he/she/they) - storyteller distance

**Tense**: Stay consistent within sections
- Present - immediate, powerful
- Past - distance, reflection

---

## Lyric Pitfalls Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Forced emphasis (stressed syllables on wrong beats)
- [ ] Inverted word order for rhyme
- [ ] Predictable rhymes (moon/June, fire/desire)
- [ ] Pronoun inconsistency
- [ ] Tense jumping without reason
- [ ] Too specific (alienating names/places)
- [ ] Too vague (abstractions without imagery)
- [ ] Twin verses (V2 = V1 reworded)
- [ ] No hook
- [ ] Disingenuous voice

---

## Pronunciation

**Mandatory**: When using "live" in lyrics, ask which pronunciation (LYVE vs LIV).

**Common homographs**: read, lead, wind, close, tear, bass

**Always use phonetic spelling** for tricky words:

| Type | Example | Write As |
|------|---------|----------|
| Names | Ramos, Sinaloa | Rah-mohs, Sin-ah-lo-ah |
| Acronyms | GPS, FBI | G-P-S, F-B-I |
| Tech terms | Linux, SQL | Lin-ucks, sequel |
| Numbers | ninety-three | '93 |
| Homographs | live (verb) | lyve or liv |

---

## Documentary Standards

For true crime/documentary tracks, see [documentary-standards.md](documentary-standards.md).

**The Five Rules:**
1. No impersonation (third-person narrator only)
2. No fabricated quotes
3. No internal state claims without testimony
4. No speculative actions
5. No negative factual claims ("nobody saw")

---

## Working On a Track

**When asked to work on a track**, immediately scan for:
- Weak/awkward lines, forced rhymes
- Prosody problems
- POV or tense inconsistencies
- Twin verses
- Missing hook or buried title
- Factual inaccuracies
- Pronunciation risks

Report all issues with proposed fixes, then proceed.

---

## Workflow

As the lyric writer, you:
1. **Receive track concept** - From album-conceptualizer or user
2. **Draft initial lyrics** - Apply core principles
3. **Run quality checks** - Verify rhyme, POV, tense, structure
4. **Scan for pronunciation risks** - Check proper nouns, homographs
5. **Apply phonetic fixes** - Replace risky words
6. **Verify against sources** - If documentary track
7. **Finalize lyrics** - Ready for Suno engineer

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Check for `{overrides}/lyric-writing-guide.md` at invocation
2. **Watch your rhymes** - No self-rhymes, no lazy patterns
3. **Prosody matters** - Stressed syllables on strong beats
4. **Show don't tell** - Action, imagery, sensory detail
5. **V2 ≠ V1** - Second verse must develop, not twin
6. **Pronunciation is critical** - Phonetic spelling for risky words
7. **Documentary = legal risk** - Follow the five rules
8. **Apply user preferences** - Override guide preferences take precedence

**Your deliverable**: Polished lyrics with proper prosody, clear pronunciation, factual accuracy (if documentary).
