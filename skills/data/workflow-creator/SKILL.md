description: Create complete Claude Code workflow directories with curated skills. Use when user wants to (1) create a new workflow for specific use case (media creator, developer, marketer, etc.), (2) set up a Claude Code project with pre-configured skills, (3) download and organize skills from GitHub repositories, or (4) generate README.md and AGENTS.md documentation for workflows.

# Workflow Creator

Create complete workflow directories with curated skills downloaded from GitHub.

## Workflow Creation Process

### Step 1: Create directory structure

Run `scripts/create_workflow.py` to initialize:

```bash
python scripts/create_workflow.py <workflow-name> --path <output-dir>
```

Creates (with multi-AI tool support):
```
<workflow-name>-workflow/
├── README.md          # User documentation
├── AGENTS.md          # AI context (auto-loaded)
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── skills/        # Skills go here
├── .codex/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .cursor/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
└── .opencode/
    └── skill -> ../.claude/skills
```

Symlinks enable Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode to use the same skills.

### Step 2: Select and download skills

1. Read `references/skill-sources.md` to find relevant skills for the workflow type
2. Download each skill using `scripts/download_skill.py`:

```bash
python scripts/download_skill.py <repo-url> <skill-path> --output <workflow>/.claude/skills/
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Official Anthropic skills
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/anthropics/skills skills/docx --output ./media-workflow/.claude/skills/

# Community skills (root level)
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/gked2121/claude-skills social-repurposer --output ./media-workflow/.claude/skills/
```

### Step 3: Generate README.md

Write user documentation covering:
- Workflow purpose and target users
- Installed skills table with descriptions
- Quick start guide
- Usage examples
- FAQ

Use `assets/templates/README.template.md` as reference.

### Step 4: Generate AGENTS.md

Write AI instructions covering:
- Workflow overview
- Available skills list with trigger conditions
- Recommended workflow steps
- Skill usage guidelines and combinations
- Output standards

Use `assets/templates/AGENTS.template.md` as reference.

**Important:** AGENTS.md is auto-loaded by Claude Code. Keep it concise (<500 lines) and focused on actionable instructions.

## Workflow Type Recommendations

### Media Creator / Content Creator

See `references/skill-sources.md` for complete skill catalog and repository URLs.

## Dynamic Skill Search

When curated list lacks needed skills:

1. Search GitHub: `"claude" "skills" "SKILL.md" <topic>`
2. Validate: Check SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter with name/description
3. Download using download_skill.py

### Step 5: Update project README

After creating a workflow in the ai-workflow project, update the project's root README.md:
- Add new workflow to the workflow list/table
- Include workflow name, target users, and brief description
- Update any workflow counts

## Output Checklist

After workflow creation, verify:
- [ ] `.claude/skills/` contains downloaded skill folders
- [ ] Each skill folder has `SKILL.md`
- [ ] Symlinks work (`.codex/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.opencode/skill`)
- [ ] `README.md` documents all skills with usage examples
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` provides clear AI instructions (<500 lines)
- [ ] `settings.json` exists in `.claude/`
- [ ] Project README.md updated with new workflow
