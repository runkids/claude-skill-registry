<!-- Older versions below -->
```

## Update Process

### 1. Analyze Recent Changes

```bash
# Get commits since last release
git log v2.1.0..HEAD --oneline

# Or since last changelog update
git log --since="2025-11-01" --oneline

# See detailed changes
git log v2.1.0..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ad)" --date=short
```

### 2. Categorize Changes

### 3. Write Changelog Entries

**Entry Format**:
```markdown
### Category

- Brief description of change in user-facing language
- Reference issue/PR if applicable: #123, #456
- Note breaking changes with migration guidance
```

**Good Examples**:
```markdown
### Added
- Browser node connection pooling for 60% faster workflow execution
- PostgreSQL and MySQL async database support with connection pooling
- Event-driven trigger system with 10 trigger types (Manual, Scheduled, Webhook, etc.)
- Project management system with hierarchical scoping (Projects → Scenarios → Workflows)
- Performance dashboard showing execution metrics and resource usage

### Changed
- Refactored MainWindow to controller pattern, reducing complexity from 1,200 to 650 lines
- Improved error handling in browser nodes with automatic retry on transient failures
- Updated test coverage from 45% to 78% for desktop automation nodes
- Migrated to strict type system with value objects (ExecutionResult, Port, DataType)

### Deprecated
- `casare_rpa.core.types` module - Use `casare_rpa.domain.value_objects.types` instead
- Dict-based port access - Use `Port` value object (removed in v3.0)
- See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details

### Fixed
- Variable resolution in nested workflow scopes (#234)
- Memory leak in browser resource manager when reusing contexts
- Race condition in async node execution with parallel workflows
- Incorrect error reporting in desktop element selection

### Security
- Updated asyncpg to 0.29.2 to patch SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-XXXXX)
- Implemented credential encryption for workflow variable storage
- Added input validation to prevent XSS in workflow JSON
```

**Bad Examples** (too technical, not user-focused):
```markdown
### Changed
- Refactored ExecutionOrchestrator.execute() method
- Updated imports in 15 files
- Changed variable name from `ctx` to `context`
```

### 4. Version and Date

For released versions:
```markdown
## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-01
```

For unreleased changes (ongoing development):
```markdown
## [Unreleased]
```

### 5. Breaking Changes Section

For major versions or significant breaking changes:

```markdown
## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-15

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Removed Compatibility Layer

The `casare_rpa.core` compatibility layer has been removed. All imports must use domain layer directly.

**Migration Required**:

```python
# OLD (no longer works):
from casare_rpa.core.types import DataType, NodeId
from casare_rpa.core import Port

# NEW (required):
from casare_rpa.domain.value_objects.types import DataType, NodeId
from casare_rpa.domain.value_objects import Port
```

**Migration Tool**: Run `python scripts/migrate_imports.py` to automatically update imports.

**Timeline**: Compatibility layer was deprecated in v2.1, showing warnings since 2025-11-27.

#### Changed Port Data Structure

Ports are now value objects instead of dictionaries.

**Migration Required**:

```python
# OLD:
port_type = node.inputs['input1']['type']
port_data = node.inputs['input1']['data']

# NEW:
port_type = node.inputs['input1'].data_type
port_data = node.inputs['input1'].default_value
```

**Impact**: All custom nodes must update port access patterns.

**Documentation**: See [Port Migration Guide](docs/migrations/port-value-objects.md)

### Added
- Complete async execution engine with connection pooling
