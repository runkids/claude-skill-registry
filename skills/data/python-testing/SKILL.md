Triggers: quality-assurance, test-automation, pytest, testing, python
  Python testing with pytest, fixtures, mocking, and TDD workflows.

  Triggers: pytest, unit tests, test fixtures, mocking, TDD, test suite, coverage,
  test-driven development, testing patterns, parameterized tests, unittest replacement,
  test coverage, pytest fixtures, async testing, test automation, pytest marks,
  test mocking, pytest plugins, integration tests, test discovery

  Use when: writing unit tests, setting up test suites, implementing TDD,
  configuring pytest, creating fixtures, async testing, writing integration tests,
  mocking dependencies, parameterizing tests, setting up CI/CD testing

  DO NOT use when: evaluating test quality - use pensive:test-review instead.
  DO NOT use when: infrastructure test config - use leyline:pytest-config.

  Consult this skill for Python testing implementation and patterns.

# Python Testing Hub

Testing standards for pytest configuration, fixture management, and TDD implementation.

## Quick Start

1.  **Dependencies**: `pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pytest-mock`
2.  **Configuration**: Add the following to `pyproject.toml`:
    ```toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    testpaths = ["tests"]
    addopts = "--cov=src"
    ```
3.  **Verification**: Run `pytest` to confirm discovery of files matching `test_*.py`.

## When to Use

- Constructing unit and integration tests for Python 3.9+ projects.
- Isolating external dependencies using `pytest-mock` or custom monkeypatching.
- Validating asynchronous logic with `pytest-asyncio` markers and event loop management.
- Configuring project-wide coverage thresholds and reporting.

## Modules

This skill uses modular loading to manage the system prompt budget.

### Core Implementation
- See `modules/unit-testing.md` - AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern, basic test structure, and exception validation.
- See `modules/fixtures-and-mocking.md` - Request-scoped fixtures, parameterization, and boundary mocking.
- See `modules/async-testing.md` - Coroutine testing, async fixtures, and concurrency validation.

### Infrastructure & Workflow
- See `modules/test-infrastructure.md` - Directory standards, `conftest.py` management, and coverage tools.
- See `modules/testing-workflows.md` - Local execution patterns and GitHub Actions integration.

### Standards
- See `modules/test-quality.md` - Identification of common anti-patterns like broad exception catching or shared state between tests.

## Exit Criteria

- Tests implement the AAA pattern.
- Coverage reaches the 80% project minimum.
- Individual tests are independent and do not rely on execution order.
- Fixtures are scoped appropriately (function, class, or session) to prevent side effects.
- Mocking is restricted to external system boundaries.

## Troubleshooting

- **Test Discovery**: Verify filenames match the `test_*.py` pattern. Use `pytest --collect-only` to debug discovery paths.
- **Import Errors**: Ensure the local source directory is in the path, typically by installing in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
- **Async Failures**: Confirm that `pytest-asyncio` is installed and that async tests use the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator or corresponding auto-mode configuration.
