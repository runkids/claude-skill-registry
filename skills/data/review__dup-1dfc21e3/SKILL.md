# Review

Quick quality check on current/recent changes.

## Execution

1. **Check what changed**
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~3  # Last 3 commits
git diff --staged --name-only  # Staged changes
```

2. **Run quality checks**
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run lint  # If available
```

3. **Scan changed files for issues**

For each changed file, check:
- `any` types or `@ts-ignore`
- console.log statements
- Hardcoded colors (text-white, bg-gray-*)
- Missing error handling
- TODO/FIXME comments

4. **Report**

```
