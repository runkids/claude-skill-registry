Triggers: patterns, templates, git, shared
  Shared infrastructure and patterns for sanctum git/workspace skills.

  Triggers: sanctum patterns, todowrite patterns, git commands, output templates,

  Use when: developing new sanctum skills, refactoring existing skills,
  ensuring consistency across sanctum workflows, referencing standard patterns

  DO NOT use directly: this skill is infrastructure for other sanctum skills.

  Provides reusable patterns consumed by all sanctum git and workspace skills.

# Shared Infrastructure for Sanctum

## Purpose
This skill provides reusable patterns, templates, and conventions used across all sanctum git and workspace skills. It validates consistency in TodoWrite naming, git command usage, and output formatting.

## Modules

### TodoWrite Patterns
The `modules/todowrite-patterns.md` module documents the naming convention for TodoWrite items across all sanctum skills:
- Pattern: `skill-name:step-name`
- Examples from commit-messages, pr-prep, git-workspace-review, doc-updates, version-updates
- Best practices for creating meaningful step names

### Git Commands
The `modules/git-commands.md` module extracts common git commands used throughout sanctum workflows:
- Repository confirmation commands
- Diff commands (staged, unstaged, stat, detailed)
- Branch and merge-base operations
- Status parsing patterns

### Output Templates
The `modules/output-templates.md` module provides standardized output formats:
- Conventional commit message structure
- Pull request description template
- Documentation update format
- Version update summary format

### GitHub Comments
The `modules/github-comments.md` module provides patterns for posting PR comments:
- Reviews API vs Comments API differences
- Inline comment patterns with correct `-F` flag for integers
- Secondary strategies when inline comments fail
- Summary comment templates

## When to Reference
- **New skill development**: Use these patterns to maintain consistency
- **Workflow refactoring**: Reference when updating existing skills
- **Cross-skill integration**: Check TodoWrite naming and git command patterns
- **Template generation**: Use output templates for standardized artifacts

## Integration Notes
This skill is infrastructure-only and does not define executable workflows. It serves as a reference for pattern consistency across sanctum's git and workspace operations.

All sanctum skills should follow these shared patterns to validate predictable behavior and maintainable code.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH

**Permission errors**
Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges

**Unexpected behavior**
Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
