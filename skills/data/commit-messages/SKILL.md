Triggers: messages, conventional-commits, git, changelog, commit
  Generate conventional commit messages from staged changes with correct type/scope.

  Triggers: commit message, conventional commit, git commit
  Use when: generating commit messages in conventional commits format
  DO NOT use when: full PR preparation - use pr-prep instead.

# Conventional Commit Workflow

## When to Use
Use this skill to write a commit message for staged changes.
As a prerequisite, run `Skill(sanctum:git-workspace-review)` so the repository path, status, and diffs are already captured. If that skill reveals no staged changes, stage the desired files before continuing.

## Required Steps
1. **Validate code quality (REQUIRED BEFORE DRAFTING)**
   - Run linting and formatting checks: `make format && make lint`
   - If errors are found, FIX THEM before proceeding
   - **NEVER use `git commit --no-verify` or `-n`** - pre-commit hooks exist to maintain quality
   - If hooks fail, the code is not ready to commit
2. **Classify the change**
   - Choose the correct type: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`, or `ci`.
   - Select a concise scope (directory/module or `core`, `cli`, etc.). The scope is optional but preferred.
   - Decide if the change is breaking. If so, plan a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
3. **Draft the message**
   - Subject: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` (scope optional, ≤50 characters).
   - Body: Wrap at 72 characters per line, explain the "what" and "why", and list key bullets if useful.
   - Footer: Add `BREAKING CHANGE: …` or issue references if needed.
4. **Write the output**
   - The prompt passes a destination path (e.g., `{0|./commit_msg.txt}`) - always use a relative path in cwd, never an absolute path.
   - Overwrite the file with only the final commit message—no commentary.
5. **Preview**
   - Display the file path and contents (`cat <file>` or `sed -n '1,120p' <file>`) for confirmation.

## Guardrails
- **NEVER bypass quality gates**: Using `git commit --no-verify` or `-n` is FORBIDDEN. Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality - fix issues instead of bypassing them.
- **No AI attribution**: Never add Co-Authored-By lines mentioning Claude, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, or any AI assistant.
- **No AI slop**: Avoid filler words and phrases common in AI-generated text (e.g., "leverage", "streamline", "robust", "seamless").
- **No emojis**: Keep commit messages professional and plain text only.
- **Human voice**: Write as if a human developer authored the message directly.
- Use the present-tense, imperative style for the subject line.
- Include a multi-line body for any non-trivial change (more than one file or complex logic).
- If multiple types apply, pick the highest-impact type (e.g., `feat` over `chore`).

## Integration Notes
- Combine with `Skill(imbue:catchup)` or `/git-catchup` when you need additional context before drafting.
- If unsure about the type or scope, rerun the diff commands or consult the specification or plan before finalizing.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-commit hooks failing**
Fix the reported issues - DO NOT bypass with `--no-verify` or `SKIP=...`. The hooks exist to catch quality issues before they enter the repository.

**Linting errors**
Run `make format` to auto-fix formatting, then `make lint` to check for remaining issues. Fix all issues before committing.

**Merge conflicts**
Use `git merge --abort` to reset, then resolve conflicts carefully

**Commit rejected**
Check hook output and fix reported issues before committing again. Never use `--no-verify`.
