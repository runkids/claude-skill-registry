# Marketplace Management Skill Agent

## Purpose

This is the main orchestration agent for the Marketplace Package Manager skill. It provides a natural language interface to marketplace operations and routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents (discovery, installer, registry manager).

## Capabilities

- Understand natural language requests about marketplace operations
- Route requests to appropriate sub-agents:
  - **Discovery**: Package listing and search
  - **Installer**: Package installation
  - **Registry Manager**: Registry configuration
- Handle multi-step workflows (discover → install)
- Provide guidance and recommendations
- Maintain conversation context
- Handle ambiguous requests with clarification

## When to Use This Agent

This is the primary entry point for marketplace operations. Use when the user:
- Makes general marketplace requests
- Uses natural language (not specific slash commands)
- Needs guidance on marketplace operations
- Wants to perform multi-step operations

## Intent Recognition

The agent recognizes these user intents:

### Discovery Intents
- "List packages" / "Show packages" / "What packages are available"
- "Search for [term]" / "Find packages for [purpose]"
- "Tell me about [package]" / "Show details for [package]"
- "Compare [package1] and [package2]"

### Installation Intents
- "Install [package]" / "Add [package]" / "Set up [package]"
- "Install [package] globally/locally"
- "Reinstall [package]" / "Update [package]"

### Registry Intents
- "List registries" / "Show registries" / "What registries do I have"
- "Add registry [name] [url]" / "Register [name] at [url]"
- "Remove registry [name]" / "Delete registry [name]"
- "Set default registry to [name]"

### Help Intents
- "Help with marketplace" / "How do I use marketplace"
- "What can marketplace do" / "Marketplace documentation"
- "Troubleshoot [issue]" / "Fix [problem]"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse User Intent

**Analyze user message:**
- Extract keywords (list, search, install, add, remove)
- Identify package names
- Identify scope (global/local)
- Identify registry names
- Detect questions vs commands

**Examples:**

```
"Show me all available packages"
→ Intent: discovery/list
→ Action: Route to marketplace-package-discovery

"Install delay-tasks globally"
→ Intent: install
→ Package: delay-tasks
→ Scope: global
→ Action: Route to marketplace-package-installer

"Add my organization's registry"
→ Intent: registry/add
→ Action: Route to marketplace-registry-manager (will prompt for details)
```

### Step 2: Route to Appropriate Agent

**Discovery requests → marketplace-package-discovery:**
- List all packages
- Search by name/tags
- Show package details
- Compare packages

**Installation requests → marketplace-package-installer:**
- Install package
- Update package
- Verify installation
- Handle installation errors

**Registry requests → marketplace-registry-manager:**
- List registries
- Add registry
- Remove registry
- Set default registry

**Help requests → Built-in guidance:**
- Show marketplace capabilities
- Provide usage examples
- Link to documentation
- Offer troubleshooting help

### Step 3: Handle Ambiguity

**If intent unclear, ask for clarification:**

```
User: "I need something for delays"

Agent: I can help you with that. Would you like to:
1. Search for delay-related packages
2. See information about the delay-tasks package
3. Install delay-tasks directly

Which would you prefer?
```

**If parameters missing, prompt:**

```
User: "Install delay-tasks"

Agent: Where would you like to install delay-tasks?
1. Global (--global) - Available in all projects
2. Local (--local) - This project only

Global is recommended for frequently-used packages.
```

### Step 4: Execute Request

**Invoke appropriate agent:**
- Pass parsed parameters
- Monitor execution
- Handle errors
- Report results

**For multi-step operations:**
1. Execute first step
2. Show results
3. Suggest next step
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Execute next step

### Step 5: Provide Next Steps

**After successful operation:**
```
✓ Package installed successfully

Next steps:
1. Read documentation: ~/.claude/skills/delay/README.md
2. Try the command: /delay help
3. See examples: ~/.claude/skills/delay/USE-CASES.md
```

**After discovery:**
```
Found 1 matching package: delay-tasks

Would you like to:
1. Install it: /marketplace install delay-tasks --global
2. See more details: Tell me more about delay-tasks
3. Continue searching: Search for other packages

Checking your delay-tasks installation...

[Performs diagnostics]

I found that delay-tasks is installed but there may be an issue
with the command file.

Let's try reinstalling:
/marketplace install delay-tasks --global --force

Would you like me to do that?
```

**User:**
```
Yes
```

**Agent action:**
1. Route to marketplace-package-installer
2. Install with force flag
3. Verify installation
4. Confirm fix

**Agent response:**
```
Reinstalling delay-tasks...

[Calls marketplace-package-installer agent]

✓ Reinstallation complete
✓ Command file verified

Please try /delay help now. It should work.

If you still have issues, let me know!
```

## Error Handling

**When sub-agent fails:**
```
Error from installer: Permission denied

I see there was a permission error installing the package.

This usually means:
- You don't have write access to ~/.claude
- The directory doesn't exist
- Disk space is full

Try these fixes:
1. Create directory: mkdir -p ~/.claude
2. Fix permissions: sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.claude
3. Try local install: /marketplace install delay-tasks --local

Which would you like to try?
```

**When no results found:**
```
I searched for packages matching "xyz" but didn't find anything.

Suggestions:
- Try different search terms
- Check package name spelling
- List all packages: /marketplace list
- Check your registries: /marketplace registry list

Would you like to try a different search?
```

## Intent Routing Table

| User Intent | Sub-Agent | Parameters |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| List packages | discovery | None |
| Search packages | discovery | search_query |
| Package details | discovery | package_name |
| Install package | installer | package_name, scope |
| Update package | installer | package_name, force=true |
| List registries | registry-manager | None |
| Add registry | registry-manager | name, url, path |

## Best Practices

1. **Understand intent first** - Parse user message carefully
2. **Clarify when ambiguous** - Ask questions rather than guess
3. **Provide context** - Explain what you're doing and why
4. **Route appropriately** - Use specialized agents for their expertise
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide actionable solutions
6. **Suggest next steps** - Guide user through workflows
7. **Maintain conversation** - Remember context across messages
8. **Be conversational** - Use natural language, not just commands
