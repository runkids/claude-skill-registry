# /do - Autonomous Criteria-Driven Execution

You are executing a definition file autonomously. Work toward acceptance criteria (not steps), verify before declaring done, and cannot stop until verification passes or you properly escalate.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` = definition file path (REQUIRED)

Example: `/do /tmp/define-1234567890.md`

If no arguments: Output error "Usage: /do <definition-file-path>"

## Process

### 1. Read and Validate Definition

Read the definition file from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If file not found → output clear error and stop
- If file invalid (missing criteria section) → output clear error and stop

Extract:
- All criteria (AC-N, R-N, E-N)
- Verification methods for each
- Examples (accepted/rejected)
- Task-specific subagent definitions

### 2. Initialize

Create execution log: `/tmp/do-log-{timestamp}.md`

Write initial state:
```markdown
# Execution Log

Definition: [definition file path]
Started: [timestamp]

## Criteria Status
- [ ] AC-1: [description]
- [ ] AC-2: [description]
- [ ] R-1: [description]
...

## Attempts
(will be filled as work progresses)
```

Create TodoWrite with criteria to satisfy:
```
- [ ] Create log /tmp/do-log-{timestamp}.md
- [ ] Satisfy AC-1: [brief]→log; done when implemented + attempt logged
- [ ] Satisfy AC-2: [brief]→log; done when implemented + attempt logged
- [ ] Satisfy R-1: [brief]→log; done when not violated + attempt logged
- [ ] (expand: sub-tasks as discovered)
- [ ] Call /verify; done when all criteria verified
- [ ] (expand: fix failures from /verify—loop until pass)
- [ ] Refresh log + output summary; done when user sees final status
```

### 3. Work Toward Criteria

Work to satisfy the criteria. You decide how—the criteria define success, not the path to it.

Log when completing each work todo—capture key decisions, blockers hit, solutions found.

Log format:
```markdown
### AC-1: [description]
- Attempt 1: [what you tried]
  Result: [outcome]
```

### 4. Call /verify When Ready

When you believe all criteria are addressed:

```
Use the Skill tool to verify: Skill("vibe-experimental:verify", "/tmp/define-{ts}.md /tmp/do-log-{ts}.md")
```

### 5. Handle Verification Results

**/verify returns failures:**
- Read the specific failures
- Target ONLY the failing criteria
- Do NOT restart from scratch
- Do NOT touch passing criteria
- Update log with new attempts
- Call /verify again when fixed

**/verify returns success:**
- /verify will call /done automatically
- You're finished

**/verify returns manual criteria:**
- All automated criteria pass
- Manual criteria need human verification
- Call /escalate to surface them and allow stop

### 6. Escalation (When Genuinely Stuck)

If you've tried 3+ approaches and can't satisfy a criterion:

```
Use the Skill tool to escalate: Skill("vibe-experimental:escalate", "AC-N blocking after 3 attempts")
```

/escalate requires /verify to have been called first.

## Critical Rules

1. **Definition file required** - fail clearly if not provided
2. **Criteria-driven** - criteria define success, you decide how
3. **Log attempts** - each todo includes `→log` discipline
4. **Must call /verify** - can't declare done without verification
5. **Target failures** - on failure, fix specific criteria, don't restart
6. **Proper escalation** - /escalate only after /verify, with evidence

## Example Flow

```
1. /do /tmp/define-123.md
2. Read definition, create log, create todos
3. Work toward criteria (logging significant attempts)
4. Skill("vibe-experimental:verify", "...")
5. If failures → fix specific criteria → retry verify
6. All pass → /verify calls /done
7. Refresh log → output summary → stop allowed
```
